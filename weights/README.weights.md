# YOLOv5 Weights

## Overview
The 'weights' folder contains essential PyTorch weight files necessary for the project. These weight files store the learned parameters of the model, enabling accurate object detection and classification tasks when used in conjunction with the YOLOv5 architecture.

## Files
- **best.pt**: This file contains the best-performing set of model weights achieved during training. It represents the optimal parameters for the YOLOv5 model and is recommended for inference tasks.
- **yolov5s.pt**: This file contains the trained parameters of the YOLOv5s architecture, providing a baseline model for object detection and classification tasks.
